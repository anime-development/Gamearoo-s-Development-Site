				Hello, It is 2021 almost the end of summer. We at Gamearoo’s Development
				want to make a few changes. @Ram v9.x will bring a brand new look with
				rotating images and statuses, it will also bring idle and online modes.
				Ram will also get a dashboard for easy setting changes , which will also
				change ram API for the better good. This change for ram shouldn’t take
				effect till v9.x. @Rem Will be getting ready for release here in a few
				months with its fully designed dashboard which u can see sneak peeks at
				#rem-dashboard. You may of notice a lot of changes to this discord to
				start to take place as fall comes around. This discord server was
				remodeled for a better experience if you have suggestions fill free to
				let us know. We will continue to develop and better bots, and with the
				experience of them, we will also do better in the discord. We hope you
				will like all the changes and thank you for all your support. - Head Of
				Development
